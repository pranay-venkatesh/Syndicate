# Syndicate

* Version 1

Grade 10 Project. The game is similar to monopoly. It's a multiplayer game to have fun with your friends. Special thanks to Hariharan B for helping me out with some bugs and errors.

* Version 2

New additions!

So, stock market used to be a very simple concept in the old game. You would just get some amount of cash over the course of time. Now, there's some actual investing that you can do.
